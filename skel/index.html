<h1>SOUL - Summary Of Usenet Links</h1>

You are probably looking for one of the following:

<p>
<a href="http://www.mcleod-schmidt.id.au/~acfsoul/archives.htm">Archives</a> -
 a list of historical links
<p>
<a href="http://www.mcleod-schmidt.id.au/~acfsoul/latest.htm">Latest</a>
 - the most recently generated links

<hr>
<h2>RSS Feed</h2>

If you would like an RSS feed for this site, then use the URL<br>
http://www.mcleod-schmidt.id.au/~acfsoul/feed.rss
<br> in your feed reader. It has been tested, and confirmed to operate correctly, in Thunderbird. All other newsreaders should work fine, too.

<p>
You can also see the feed directly <a href="http://www.mcleod-schmidt.id.au/~acfsoul/feed2js.htm">here</a>.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Q01 How can I get my link added to the list?</h3>

People sometimes attempt to add URLs to my summary links by replying to my original "alt.comp.freeware links at NNN" postings. This is not a good idea, because it means that your URL will be categorised under the heading of "alt.comp.freeware links ...", rather than a heading that is more meaningful for your URL.

<p>
Your best bet (it really is better for you!) is simply to post a
normal message to the alt.comp.freeware group giving a meaningful
subject line and body message. Don't forget to give the URL that you
want people to go to. SOUL identifies URLs as those beginning with www
or http, so something like 

<pre>
    www.markcarter.me.uk
</pre>
or
<pre>
    http://www.markcarter.me.uk
</pre>
will do just as well. SOUL will
automatically read your message when it does its batch run and
summarise it for you. Simple!

<h3>Q02 Shouldn't your list eliminate spam/off-topic content?</h3>
Ideally, yes. In reality, SOUL would have to be much more sophisticated, and would require a programming effort that I am not prepared to make. The links are generated automatically by the SOUL robot, and it has absolutely no way of distinguishing between genuine freeware and pr0n, malware, and suchlike. SOUL has sources which are in the public domain, so feel free to enhance it how you wish. If you get something really super going, then I'd be happy to hand over the reins to you.


<hr><h2>Sources</h2>

SOUL is not really in a fit state to be used by others, but if you 
really want to look at the code, you can obtain it at github: <br>
