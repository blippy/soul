ANN: soul.py v0.8 - Summary Of Usenet Links

Description
-----------

SOUL is a python script that downloads news articles (e.g. from
Usenet) via NNTP, and summarises the articles that it finds. It is
currently in an alpha stage, quite usable, but unlikely to move beyond
the alpha stage.


Usage
-----

Typical usage might be:
python soul.py -g alt.comp.freeware --last acf.txt \
   -p password -s news.individual.net -u username

The --last option specifies a file to store the ID of the last article
in the group. Specify a non-existent filename (the initials of the
group would be a sensible choice) when you first run it for a
particular group. Soul will then only summarise the last 10 articles
to the group. Subsequent runs will remember the last article read, so
it should prove more useful after that.

For detailed help on usage and options, type:
python soul.py -h


Requirements
------------


Requires the python programming language to work. It is known to work
with version 2.3.3 (or later), although slightly earlier versions
might work (it makes use of sets). This project is hard-coded, so you
are unlikely to be able to adapt it easily to similar projects.


Terms of use
------------

SOUL has been placed in the Public Domain. You can do what you want with it.
